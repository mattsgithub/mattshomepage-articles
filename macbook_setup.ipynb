    "# VIM\n",
    "\n",
    "I use VIM for writing code and what I love about VIM, is my daily practice in it makes it easy to edit files on a remote server with no GUI. VIM has tons of plugins as well.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Basic VIM Setup\n",
    "In my ~/.vimrc file, I have the following lines set:\n",

    "<code>syntax on\n",
    "filetype plugin on\n",
    "set number relativenumber\n",

The <code>filetype plugin on</code> is necessary for when some of the vim plugins act on specific file types (such as python files--an example being Flake8, which I will go over shortly). The <code>set number relativenumber</code> makes VIM use relative numbering for me. Thus, I can see relative to the line I'm on, that 10 lines above me, is some line of code. I can then type \"5 k\" and move 5 lines up to the specific line of code I want to navigate to. The <code>set tabstop=4</code> makes my tabs convert to 4 spaces. And, suppose I'm doing a group indentation in VIM by <code>4 >></code>. The line <code>set shiftwidth=4</code> ensures that this also uses 4 spaces for a tab.\n",

Otherwise, VIM tends to spread these files out in different directories (~/.vim/plugin, ~/.vim/syntax, ~/.vim/doc, etc.). In general, if you want to know about customizing VIM, see http://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/.\n",
